- Quality over quantity in surprise planning
- Sometimes the best surprise is simply your full attention and presence
- Celebrate both special occasions AND random ordinary days

🌟 REMEMBER: The best surprises come from knowing what makes Priya smile, paying attention to her interests and needs, and showing love through thoughtful actions. It's not about spending money - it's about spending time thinking of ways to bring joy to her day! 🌟
